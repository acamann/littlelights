A special thanks to Jordan Maedgen for leading the event for Generation One! At each of our events this month we talked about a story in which kindness cam full circle, spreading from one person to the next until it reached back to the original one who did a kind deed out of love. We talked about how Jesus came to the earth as the perfect example of love. While we can never be perfect like him, we can change the world by giving His love to others and watching kindness "catch on" and spread.
