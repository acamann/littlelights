excerpt: All Ali and I can say about February is **WOW!** In the midst of a
  crazy winter storm, our children were able to show God's love as we packed
  over 100 homeless care packages, decorated more than 300 Valentine's cards for
  the seniors at Treemont, prepared over 200 weekend meal bags for Blessings in
  a Backpack, and bagged over 100 pounds of rice for the East Spring Branch Food
  Pantry. I think that is pretty extraordinary.
