At most of the events last month, I told the story of The Good Samaritan (sometimes using Power Rangers as props!). We talked about how the good helper had every reason to not stop and give his time and energy on a dangerous road. The children heard how it's not always fun or the easiest thing to stop and help, but we should always be looking for ways to share God's love with others.
